  heroIntroduction: 'Creating visual narratives that capture authentic moments and timeless stories.',
  biography: `Sarah Mitchell is an award-winning photographer specializing in editorial and commercial work, with recognition including the International Photography Awards Editorial Photographer of the Year 2023 and PDN Photo Annual Winner 2022. With over a decade of experience, her work has been featured in numerous international publications and exhibitions, collaborating with clients such as Vogue, The New York Times, National Geographic, Adobe, Apple, Nike, and Architectural Digest.

Based in New York with an MFA in Photography from the School of Visual Arts, Sarah brings a unique perspective to every project, combining technical excellence with artistic vision. Her approach to photography is deeply rooted in storytelling, believing that every image should convey emotion and meaning beyond its visual appeal.`,
  approach: `My photography is guided by three principles: authenticity, composition, and light. I believe the best images emerge when subjects feel comfortable and genuine, when composition guides the viewer's eye naturally, and when light reveals the essence of the moment.

Whether working on editorial assignments or commercial projects, I strive to create images that transcend their immediate purpose and become lasting visual statements.`,
